    <!-- Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.

You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:

On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels.
On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels.
The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.

The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u. -->

    <script>
        function whoWnin(s){
            const vowels = new Set(['a','e','i','o','u']);
            let count = 0;

            for(let char of s){
                if(vowels.has(char)){
                    count++;
                }
            }

            return count > 0;
        }

        console.log(whoWnin('klka'));
