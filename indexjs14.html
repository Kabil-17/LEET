//Create a class ArrayWrapper that accepts an array of integers in its constructor. This class should have two features:
//When two instances of this class are added together with the + operator, the resulting value is the sum of all the elements in both arrays.
//When the String() function is called on the instance, it will return a comma separated string surrounded by brackets. For example, [1,2,3].

        class arrayWrapper{
            constructor(arr){
                this.arr=arr
            }
        
            valueOf(){
            return this.arr.reduce((acc,sum)=> acc+sum,0)
            }
            toString(){
                return this.arr.join(',');
            }
    }
        const obj1 = new arrayWrapper([1,2,3,4,5])
        const obj2 = new arrayWrapper([1,2])
        console.log(obj1.valueOf());
        console.log(obj2.valueOf());
        console.log(obj1+obj2);
        console.log(String(obj1));
