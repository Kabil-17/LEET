    <!-- Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.  -->

            while (n !== 1 && !seen.has(n)) {
                seen.add(n);
                let sum = 0;
                let temp = n;

                    sum += digit * digit;
                    temp = Math.floor(temp / 10);
