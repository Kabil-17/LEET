    <!-- Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.

You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:

On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels.
On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels.
The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.

The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u. -->
    <script>
        function doesAliceWin(s) {
    const vowels = new Set(['a','e','i','o','u']);
    let count = 0;

    for (let ch of s) {
        if (vowels.has(ch)) count++;
    }

    if (count === 0) return false;

    return true;
}
